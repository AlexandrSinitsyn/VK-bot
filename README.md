Bot that will simplify studying process by simplifying teacher-student interconnection.
Now, it will become just one-click to get your homework results as long as on click for uploading it.

**now it is impossible to have one instance of bot for several courses/classes.
So, for each class you should have independent bot. It is not very comfortable, so it is going to be modified*
